# GestionNotesEtudiantFront
This project is a grade management application for a school, developed using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application allows for managing student grades based on their class, level, subjects, and teachers. At the end of the year, orientation suggestions are provided based on each student's academic performance.
