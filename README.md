# Student Grades Management System

This project is a grade management application for a school, developed using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application allows for managing student grades based on their class, level, subjects, and teachers. At the end of the year, orientation suggestions are provided based on each student's academic performance.


### Main Features
- **Student Management**: Add, modify, and delete student information (name, class, level, etc.).
- **Subject Management**: Assign subjects to classes and teachers.
- **Grade Management**: Input and review student grades for each subject.
- **Orientation Suggestions**: Generate orientation recommendations for each student at the end of the year based on their grades.
- **Teacher Management**: Add, modify, and delete teachers and their subjects.

## Project Architecture
The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Frontend (Angular)**:
   - User interface for managing students, teachers, subjects, and grades.
   - API calls to the backend for database interaction.

2. **Backend (Spring Boot)**:
   - API routes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on students, teachers, subjects, and grades.
   - Database management to store the information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java
- **Database**: MySQL (or any other relational DBMS)
- **Build tools**: Maven

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed for Angular.
